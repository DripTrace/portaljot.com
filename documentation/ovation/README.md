# Advanced Browser Features Implementation Guide

This guide details the implementation of specific advanced browser features with TypeScript examples and includes how to link a Web App Manifest in HTML.

## Reporting API

The Reporting API enables the monitoring and reporting of various issues that can occur on a website.

### Example Configuration

1. **Add a `Report-To` HTTP Header**: This header specifies the endpoint where the browser should send the reports.

   ```http
   Report-To: {"group":"default","max_age":31536000,"endpoints":[{"url":"https://ourdomain.com/report"}],"include_subdomains":true}
   ```

2. **Use `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) Directive**: This directive specifies where reports should be sent when CSP violations occur.

   ```http
   Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; report-uri /csp-report-endpoint;
   ```

## Proximity Sensor

Due to the lack of direct browser API support for a generic proximity sensor, an alternative approach involves using Web Bluetooth to connect to external devices capable of measuring proximity.

### Alternative Approach Example (Conceptual)

- **Connecting to a Proximity Sensor Device via Web Bluetooth**:

  ```typescript
  navigator.bluetooth
    .requestDevice({
      acceptAllDevices: true,
      optionalServices: ["battery_service"], // Replace with the appropriate service for our device
    })
    .then((device) => device.gatt.connect())
    .then((server) => {
      // Access the service and characteristic for proximity data here
    })
    .catch((error) => console.error(error));
  ```

## Shape Detection API

The Shape Detection API is experimental and may not be widely supported across all browsers. It can detect faces, barcodes, and texts in images.

### Example Usage (Barcodes)

- **Detecting Barcodes in an Image**:

  ```typescript
  if ("BarcodeDetector" in window) {
    const barcodeDetector = new BarcodeDetector();
    barcodeDetector
      .detect(imageElement)
      .then((barcodes) => {
        barcodes.forEach((barcode) => console.log(barcode.rawValue));
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        console.error("Barcode detection failed:", err);
      });
  }
  ```

## Web App Manifest

The Web App Manifest allows web applications to be installed on the user’s device, providing a richer user experience.

### Example `manifest.json`

```json
{
  "short_name": "SocialNFT",
  "name": "Blockchain/NFT Social Media Platform",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "icon/lowres.webp",
      "sizes": "48x48",
      "type": "image/webp"
    },
    {
      "src": "icon/hd_highres.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ],
  "start_url": "/",
  "background_color": "#FFFFFF",
  "display": "standalone",
  "scope": "/",
  "theme_color": "#000000"
}
```

# Linking Web App Manifest in HTML

To enable web applications to be installed on the user’s device and provide a richer user experience, a Web App Manifest is used. This manifest file is a JSON document that describes the application, including its name, icons, and entry point.

## Steps to Link Manifest in HTML

1. **Create the Manifest File**: First, ensure we have a manifest file named `manifest.json` in our project directory. This file contains information about our web application in JSON format.

2. **Linking the Manifest**: To make the browser recognize and use our Web App Manifest, we need to link to it within the `<head>` section of our HTML document.

### Example

````html
<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json" />

## Linking in `example.html`: To ensure the manifest is recognized and utilized
by the browser, link to it within the
<head>
  section of our HTML document. ```html
  <link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json" />
</head>
````

# Next Steps: Creating a Business Plan
