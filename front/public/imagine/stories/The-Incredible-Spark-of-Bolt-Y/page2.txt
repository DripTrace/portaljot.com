Bolt-Y's quest led him to the mystical depths of Dynamo Forest, where trees were not mere wood but composed of sparkling copper and twinkling circuits. As he ventured deeper, he crossed a shimmering brook that winked with flashes of electricity and discovered the heart of the forest: the Cave of Echoes. With each step inside the cave, the air hummed louder, a sign of the crystal's powers. Suddenly, a warm glow caught Bolt-Y's attention. There, nestled among glittering rocks, was the Energy Crystal, casting dazzling rainbows.
