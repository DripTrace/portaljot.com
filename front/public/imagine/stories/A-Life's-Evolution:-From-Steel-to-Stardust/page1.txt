In a sprawling workshop filled with the hum of gears and whirs of pistons, the Bio-Organic Robot named Zarlie was born. Zarlie's steel body gleamed under the factory lights, a blend of polished silver and glowing blue lines tracing across her surface like veins of light. Her eyes, large and luminous, shone with a bright amber hue, resembling sunset trapped in crystal. She stood about five feet tall, with joints engineered for graceful movements.
