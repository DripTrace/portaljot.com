In a world filled with gadgets and whirring machines stood two inseparable friends, Robo and Click. Robo was a shiny robot with a metallic silver exterior that reflected the sunny skies. He had bright blue LED eyes that sparkled with curiosity and a chest panel filled with colorful lights that flickered when he was happy. Click was a smaller, rounder robot with a warm copper body, smooth and polished. He had joyful green eyes, and a square antenna on his head that wobbled when he laughed.
