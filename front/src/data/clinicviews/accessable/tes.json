You must take into consideration information from multiple sources. Scores of 2 or 3 on a single Symptom question reflect often-occurring behaviors. Scores of 4 or 5 on Performance questions reflect problems in performance.</p><p>The initial assessment scales, parent and teacher, have 2 components: symptom assessment and impairment in performance. On both the parent and teacher initial scales, the symptom assessment screens for symptoms that meet criteria for both inattentive (items 1–9) and hyperactive ADHD (items 10–18).</p><p>To meet DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis, one must have at least 6 positive responses to either the inattentive 9 or hyperactive 9 core symptoms, or both. A positive response is a 2 or 3 (often, very often) (you could draw a line straight down the page and count the positive answers in each subsegment).</p><p>There is a place to record the number of positives in each subsegment, and a place for total score for the first 18 symptoms (just add them up).</p><p>The initial scales also have symptom screens for 3 other comorbidities—oppositional-defiant, conduct, and anxiety/depression. These are screened by the number of positive responses in each of the segments separated by the 'squares.' The specific item sets and numbers of positives required for each co-morbid symptom screen set are detailed below.</p><p>The second section of the scale has a set of performance measures, scored 1 to 5, with 4 and 5 being somewhat of a problem/problematic. To meet criteria for ADHD there must be at least one item of the Performance set in which the child scores a 4 or 5; ie, there must be impairment, not just symptoms to meet diagnostic criteria. The sheet has a place to record the number of positives (4s, 5s) and an Average Performance Score—add them up and divide by number of Performance criteria answered.</p></div></div><section style='background-color: #D1E0EB; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;'><h2 style='color: #0C3C60;'>Parent Assessment Scale</h2><h3>Predominantly Inattentive subtype</h3><ul><li>Must score a 2 or 3 on 6 out of 9 items on questions 1–9 AND</li><li>Score a 4 or 5 on any of the Performance questions 48–55</li></ul><h3>Predominantly Hyperactive/Impulsive subtype</h3><ul><li>Must score a 2 or 3 on 6 out of 9 items on questions 10–18 AND</li><li>Score a 4 or 5 on any of the Performance questions 48–55</li></ul><h3>ADHD Combined Inattention/Hyperactivity</h3><ul><li>Requires the above criteria on both inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity</li></ul><h3>Oppositional-Defiant Disorder Screen</h3><ul><li>Must score a 2 or 3 on 4 out of 8 behaviors on questions 19–26 AND</li><li>Score a 4 or 5 on any of the Performance questions 48–55</li></ul><h3>Conduct Disorder Screen</h3><ul><li>Must score a 2 or 3 on 3 out of 14 behaviors on questions 27–40 AND</li><li>Score a 4 or 5 on any of the Performance questions 48–55</li></ul><h3>Anxiety/Depression Screen</h3><ul><li>Must score a 2 or 3 on 3 out of 7 behaviors on questions 41–47 AND</li><li>Score a 4 or 5 on any of the Performance questions 48–55</li></ul></section><section style='background-color: #D1E0EB; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;'><h2 style='color: #0C3C60;'>Teacher Assessment Scale</h2><h3>Predominantly Inattentive subtype</h3><ul><li>Must score a 2 or 3 on 6 out of 9 items on questions 1–9 AND</li><li>Score a 4 or 5 on any of the Performance questions 36–43</li></ul><h3>Predominantly Hyperactive/Impulsive subtype</h3><ul><li>Must score a 2 or 3 on 6 out of 9 items on questions 10–18 AND</li><li>Score a 4 or 5 on any of the Performance questions 36–43</li></ul><h3>ADHD Combined Inattention/Hyperactivity</h3><ul><li>Requires the above criteria on both inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity</li></ul><h3>Oppositional-Defiant/Conduct Disorder Screen</h3><ul><li>Must score a 2 or 3 on 3 out of 10 items on questions 19–28 AND</li><li>Score a 4 or 5 on any of the Performance questions 36–43</li></ul><h3>Anxiety/Depression Screen</h3><ul><li>Must score a 2 or 3 on 3 out of 7 items on questions 29–35 AND</li><li>Score a 4 or 5 on any of the Performance questions 36–43</li></ul></section><section style='background-color: #D1E0EB; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;'><h2 style='color: #0C3C60;'>Follow-up Scales</h2><p>The parent and teacher follow-up scales have the first 18 core ADHD symptoms, not the co-morbid symptoms.
