# Screening Test/Interview Responses

---

### 1. Are you currently unemployed?

I am currently a freelance full-stack developer, focusing on building and maintaining web applications using technologies like Next.js, TypeScript, and Node.js. However, I am exploring new opportunities that align with my skills and aspirations in the technology sector.

---

### 2. Can you explain the difference between front-end and back-end development?

Front-end development involves creating the user interface and user experience aspects of a web application. It deals with everything the user interacts with directly, such as layouts, buttons, and text. Technologies commonly used include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with frameworks like React.js, Vue.js, and Angular.

Back-end development, on the other hand, focuses on the server side of an application. It involves managing databases, server logic, authentication, and API creation. Technologies commonly used include Node.js, Python, Java, and databases like MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. The back-end ensures that the front-end has the data and functionality it needs to serve the user.

### 4. Describe a project where you were responsible for both the front-end and back-end development

Recently, I worked with a psychiatric clinic to digitize their office operations. This involved building a new website using Next.js with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a seamless and modern user experience. On the back-end, I used Node.js and Express.js, with PostgreSQL as the database, to handle patient records, appointment scheduling, and communication systems, including VoIP and SMS integration. This project allowed me to utilize a full-stack approach, ensuring all aspects of the clinic’s digital transformation were handled effectively.

---

### 5. What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

One significant challenge was optimizing the performance of the clinic’s appointment scheduling system under high traffic conditions. I encountered issues with slow response times due to inefficient database queries. To overcome this, I implemented indexing in PostgreSQL, optimized query logic, and introduced server-side caching. This reduced the average response time significantly, resulting in a more responsive application.

---

### 6. How do you ensure the security of a web application you're developing?

I ensure security by following best practices such as:

- **Input Validation:** Preventing SQL injection and XSS attacks by validating and sanitizing user input.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Implementing secure authentication mechanisms like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and ensuring that users only access data they are authorized to see.
- **Encryption:** Using HTTPS for secure data transmission and encrypting sensitive data at rest.
- **Regular Security Audits:** Performing regular code reviews and vulnerability scanning to identify and mitigate potential security threats.

---

### 7. Can you explain the concept of RESTful APIs and how you've utilized them in your projects?

RESTful APIs are web services that adhere to the constraints of REST (Representational State Transfer). They use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. In my projects, such as the clinic's digital transformation, I created RESTful APIs to manage patient data, appointments, and communication services. This allowed the front-end to interact seamlessly with the back-end services, ensuring a smooth user experience.

---

### 8. What version control systems are you familiar with, and how do you use them in your workflow?

I am proficient in using Git as my version control system. I use Git for:

- **Branching:** Creating separate branches for new features, bug fixes, and experimental work.
- **Commit Management:** Writing meaningful commit messages and making atomic commits for better traceability.
- **Pull Requests/Code Reviews:** Collaborating with team members by submitting pull requests and reviewing code to ensure quality and adherence to standards.
- **Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD):** Integrating Git with CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment processes.

---

### 9. Have you worked with databases? If so, what types of databases have you used, and what was your role in database design and management?

Yes, I have worked with both SQL and NoSQL databases. I have used:

- **PostgreSQL:** For relational data management, where I designed normalized schemas, wrote complex queries, and managed database migrations.
- **MongoDB:** For handling unstructured data in NoSQL format, where I designed document-based schemas and optimized data retrieval with indexing.

In both cases, I was responsible for database design, query optimization, and ensuring data integrity through validation and constraints.

---

### 10. How do you approach debugging and troubleshooting when you encounter a problem in your code?

My approach to debugging includes:

- **Reproducing the Issue:** Replicating the bug in a controlled environment.
- **Logging:** Using console logs and logging tools to trace the error.
